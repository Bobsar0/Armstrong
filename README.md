# Armstrong
A 3-digit armstrong checker demo app

## DESCRIPTION
A 3-digit Armstrong number is a 3-digit integer whose sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number. For eg: 371 is an Armstrong number as 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371. The app takes in a number to be checked, determines that the number is a 3 digit integer, performs some computations on the number to ascertain its 'armstrong-ness' and displays the result.
